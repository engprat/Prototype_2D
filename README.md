**Prototype 2D**

Prototype 2D is a Unity-based experimentation project that incorporates the Boximon Cyclops asset within a 3D green grass environment. The primary focus of this project is to explore and refine first-person view and movement mechanics, providing a practical testing ground for understanding and improving first-person interactions in a 3D space.


Features:
  - Boximon Cyclops Asset: Utilizes the Boximon Cyclops model from Unity, integrating it into a new setting to test and observe its behavior within a first-person perspective. This asset serves as the primary interactive element in the scene.
  
  - 3D Environment: The project is set in a vibrant 3D green grass environment, designed to provide a visually appealing and immersive backdrop for testing first-person mechanics. The environment includes terrain, foliage, and other elements to simulate a natural setting.
  
  - First-Person View: Implements a first-person camera system to offer a player perspective that enhances immersion. This feature allows users to experience the scene and interactions as if they were within the environment.
  
  - First-Person Movement: Focuses on developing and fine-tuning first-person movement mechanics, including walking, running, and jumping. The movement system is designed to be intuitive and responsive, allowing for fluid navigation of the 3D space.
  
  - Interaction Testing: Includes basic interaction functionalities to test how the Boximon Cyclops and other elements in the environment respond to first-person controls. This helps in evaluating interaction dynamics and user feedback.


Usage: Prototype 2D is designed for developers and designers to experiment with first-person view and movement within a 3D environment. It provides a controlled setting for testing and refining first-person mechanics, offering insights into how these features perform with specific assets and environments.

Future Development: The project serves as a foundational platform for further development and refinement. Future updates may include additional features such as advanced interaction mechanics, expanded environmental elements, and enhanced visual effects based on testing results and user feedback.
